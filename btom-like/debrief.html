            <p class="text-left">Thank you for your participation in today’s experiment. Our research depends entirely on volunteers such as yourself, and we appreciate your being willing to commit time and energy to today’s experiment.</p>

            <h3 class="text-left"><b>Purpose of this study:</b></h3>
            <p class="text-left">Smooth social interactions require people to intuit what’s going on in other people’s minds at any given moment. Truly successful social interactions require people to use momentary
            information to predict what emotions or actions others might experience in the future. If your friend is disappointed at the grades they got back just now, how would they behave later when you meet up for 
            dinner? Previous research show that people have accurate intuition of such predictions, but how does this predictive accuracy come about? 
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="text-left"><b>How is this being tested?</b></h3>
            <p class="text-left">In this study, we asked you to predict the emotion and actions of the average person.</p>

            <h3 class="text-left"><b>Hypothesis and main questions:</b></h3>
            <p class="text-left">The way in which the brain processes social information and ultimately understands other minds is still open for debate. Here, we are interested in gaining a better understanding of
            what drives predictive accuracy for emotion prediction. We will test a novel approach for modeling these predictions to explain how participants are able to make accurate predictions.</p>
