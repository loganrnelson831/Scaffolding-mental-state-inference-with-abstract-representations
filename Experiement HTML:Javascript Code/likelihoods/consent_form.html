We will describe the potential implications of the results of the study both if our hypotheses are supported and if they are disconfirmed. If you wish, you can send an email message to Professor Diana Tamir (dtamir@princeton.edu) and we will send you a copy of any manuscripts based on the research (or summaries of our results).

            <h5 class="text-left"><b>Confidentiality:</b></h5>
            <p class="text-left">
                All records from this study will be kept confidential. Your participation in this study will remain confidential, and your identity will not be stored with your data. We will not include any information that will make it possible to identify you in any report we might publish. Your responses will be assigned a code number, and the list connecting your name with this number will be kept in a locked room and/or on 
                password-protected computers. When data are shared, your name will never be shared. The research team will be the only party that will have access to your data.
                <br><br>
                The results from your study may be pooled with those of other similar studies and shared among researchers or used for teaching purposes. For example, a researcher at another institution may wish to reexamine the results of this study. When results are shared, they are identified only by a code number. At no time will any identifying information such as your name be shared. Please choose not to participate in this study if you are 
                uncomfortable with your coded data being shared.
            </p>
